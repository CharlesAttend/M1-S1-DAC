    "# Practical works 9 & 10 : Face recognition by Eigenfaces method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The objective of this practical work is to study the properties of the Eigenfaces face recognition method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose to develop a system capable of:\n",
    "- identify a face from a database of faces \n",
    "- determine whether an image contains a face present in the database\n",
    "- to decide whether an image represents a face or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools developed in this practical work will be applied on the Yale Faces Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of face recognition is defined as follows: given a face image, one wishes to determine the identity of the corresponding person.\n",
    "To this end, it is necessary to have reference images, in the form of a database of faces of all persons known by the system. \n",
    "Each face is associated to a vector of characteristics. \n",
    "These characteristics are supposed to be invariant for the same person, and different from one person to another one. \n",
    "Face recognition then consists in comparing the vector of characteristics of the face to be recognized with those of each of the faces of the database. \n",
    "This makes it possible to find the person in the database having the most similar face.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of methods, distinguished by the type of characteristics used, see _S.A. Sirohey, C.L. Wilson, and R. Chellappa. Human and machine recognition of faces: A survey. Proceedings of the IEEE, 83(5), 1995_ for a state of the art:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The approaches by face models proceed to a biometric analysis of faces. Pertinent biometrics are the distance between the eyes, length of the nose, shape of the chin...\n",
    "- Image based approaches, by contrast, directly compare faces, considering them as images, for which measures of pre-attentive similarities (without a priori model) are defined.\n",
    "- Hybrid approaches use the notions of similarity between images, but add a priori knowledge about the structure of a face.\n",
    "\n",
    "![principe.png](./figs/Figure_1.png)\n",
    "<center>Figure 1: General Principle of a Face Recognition System</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis by Eigenfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition by Eigenfaces is an image-based approach. \n",
    "Each face image is considered as a vector in a space having as many dimensions as the number of pixels in the image. \n",
    "The image characteristics are extracted by a method of dimensionality reduction based on principal component analysis (PCA). \n",
    "This approach was originally proposed in 1991, see Mr. Turk and A. Pentland. Eigenfaces for recognition. J. Cognitive Neuroscience, 3(1) :71-86, 1991_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will use the italic notation to designate scalars ($m, K,\\dots$) and vectors ($x, u$), and boldface  for the matrices ($\\mathbf X, \\mathbf X_c, \\mathbf W, \\dots$).\n",
    "\n",
    "A face image is noted $x$ and represented as a vector of $d$ components. $x[i] (i=0,\\cdots,d-1)$ is the pixel number $i$ of this image. A set of faces form a cloud of points in the space $\\mathbb{R}^d$. \n",
    "The database is divided into two sets: the *training* or *reference* set, used to learn the faces, and the *test* set, used to test the method. \n",
    "Faces of the training set are denoted by $x_k^{train}$ $(k=0,\\cdots,N_{train}-1)$ and faces of the test set are denoted by $x_k^{test}$ $(k=0,\\cdots,N_{test}-1) (k=0,\\cdots,N_{test}-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note $x_{average}$ the average of the reference faces, or average face. \n",
    "The principle of the Eigenfaces method is to model the difference of any face in relation to this average face by a linear combination of a limited number of images $u_h$, called Eigenfaces. \n",
    "One image of face $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is thus expressed as the average face to which is added a linear combination of eigenfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = x_{average} + \\sum_h a_h u_h + \\varepsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_h$ represents the weight of *the eigenface* of index $h$ in the face $x$, and $\\varepsilon$ represents the error between $x$ and its approximation by eigenfaces (error is due to the truncation of the basis of eigenvectors). \n",
    "Coefficients $a_h$ play a very important role for face recognition, because they correspond to the face coordinates $x$ in the face subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eigenfaces method is based on the fact that the number of eigenfaces is much smaller than the total size of the space, which is called dimensionality reduction. In other words, the basis of eigenfaces is truncated, keeping only the vectors coding for the most significant information.\n",
    "The images are therefore analyzed in a sub-space of reduced dimensions, which represents more specifically faces, among all possible types of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average face is always the same for a fixed reference database, each face is examined after subtraction of the average face.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Face database\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Yale Faces image database, http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html.\n",
    "In this database, all the faces have been preprocessed, in order to resize and crop them to the size $64\\times64$ pixels, so the images can be compared pixel per pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains 120 greyscale images, representing the faces of 15 people. There are 8 images per person, each corresponding to a category of images varying according to the following criteria (see Figure 2):\n",
    "- variation of facial expression: normal, sad, sleepy, surprised,\n",
    "    wink, happy\n",
    "- variation of accessories: glasses, noglasses,\n",
    "\n",
    "![database.png](./figs/Figure_2.png)\n",
    "<center>Figure 2: Illustration of the shooting categories</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is divided into two groups: the reference group will be used as a training set, the other group as a test set: \n",
    "- the reference base contains $n$ images, each with a number of pixels $d=n_l\\times n_c$. There are $6$ images per person in the training database, so $n=6\\times15=90$. Each image is $64\\times64$, hence $d=4096$, \n",
    "- the test base contains $2$ images per person so a total of 30 images. Each image is again $64\\times64$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we always manipulate face images in the form of vectors, and a set of faces in the form of a matrix where each column is a face. \n",
    "As we use Numpy, the images are stored in a multidimensionnal array of reals (double). \n",
    "This array is viewed as a matrix $\\mathbf X$ of size $d\\times n$: $$\\mathbf X= \\left[ x_0, ..., x_{n-1}\\right]$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\mathbf X$ is split into $\\mathbf X^{train}$ and $\\mathbf X^{test}$ of size $d\\times N_{train}$ and $d\\times N_{test}$, respectively."
