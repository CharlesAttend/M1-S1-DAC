Milner's scheduler example.

Contents:

components:
	basic component, replicated in all models

mksched:
	a tcl script for generating milner scheduler models in tpn format
	(usage, e.g.    mksched 100 > m100.tpn)

m*.tpn:
	example models obtained my mksched (recommended for tedd)

milner10000.net:
	see below

milner10.ndr:
	the result of drawing m10.tpn in nd, for understanding the models

----

NOTE: interpreting tpn scripts producing very large nets can be slow.
For repeated experiments on the same (large) net, it may be convenient to convert first
the .tpn description into an equivalent .net, using tool ndrio, e.g. 

      ndrio m5000.tpn m5000.net
      tedd m5000.net
      tedd -pnmc m5000.net -order-lexical
      tedd -pnmc m5000.net -order-force
