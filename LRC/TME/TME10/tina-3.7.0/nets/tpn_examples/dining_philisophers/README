Contents:

components:
	basic component, replicated in all models

mkphilo:
	a tcl script for generating philosopher models in tpn format
	(usage, e.g.    mkphilo 100 > p100.tpn)

p*.tpn:
	example models obtained my mksched (recommended for tedd)

p10000.net:
	see below

philosophers5.ndr:
	the result of drawing p5.tpn in nd, for understanding the models

----

NOTE: interpreting tpn scripts producing very large nets can be slow.
For repeated experiments on the same (large) net, it may be convenient to first convert
the .tpn description into an equivalent .net, using tool ndrio, e.g. 

      ndrio p5000.tpn p5000.net
      tedd p5000.net
      tedd -pnmc p5000.net -order-lexical
      tedd -pnmc p5000.net -order-force
