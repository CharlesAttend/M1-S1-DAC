bcg support:
------------

Format  bcg  is one  of  the formats  supported  by  the CADP  toolbox
(available at http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy/cadp).  

Bcg support is only available  on linux and windows (please contact us
if you need bcg support for other targets).

To enable bcg support:

1. Properly  install the CADP toolset you  your machine.

2. Update variable CADP in Makefile, if needed.

3. Type  make to  build  the interface  library  libbcg.so (linux)  or
libbcg.dll (windows). This library is  needed by tina for bcg support.
The Makefile provided assumes gcc and gmake available (on linux).  For
Windows, it is  assumed to be run from a mingw  shell; please adapt if
you are using another compiler.

4. Move  libbcg.{so|dll} to  a  suitable place.  For Linux,  libbcg.so
should be in  one of the directories in  variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For
Windows,  it should  be  enough  to move  libbcg.dll  into tina's  bin
directory.
