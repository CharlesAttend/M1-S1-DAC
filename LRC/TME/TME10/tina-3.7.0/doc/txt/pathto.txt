pathto(n)                                                            pathto(n)



NAME
       pathto  - compute path to a state in a ktz description

       Part of Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets.


SYNOPSIS
       pathto [-help]
              tgt [-from src]
              [-p | -t | -s | -l]
              [infile] [outfile] [errorfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Given  a kripke transition system in a ktz file, a target state identi-
       fied by its rank in the kts file, and a source state (default 0),  com-
       putes a path in the kts from the source to the destination state.


OPTIONS
       -help  Recalls options.


       Source and destination states:


       tgt    The target state, identified by its rank in the ktz file.

              -from  src  The source state (default 0), identified by its rank
              in the ktz file.



       Output format flags:


       -p     Prints path from src to tgt as a series of states (ranks)  sepa-
              rated  by transition (names). This is the default output format.


       -t     Prints path from src to tgt as a series of  transition  (names).
              Such  sequences  are  conformant  to the .scn format expected by
              plan, play or the nd stepper.


       -s     Prints path from src to tgt as a series of states (ranks).


       -l     Prints the length of a path from src to tgt.



       Input source:


       infile A ktz file.


       Output destination:


       outfile
              Where the result path or its length is written (default  stdin).


       Errors destination:


       errorfile
              Where error messages are written (default stderr).

       pathto 4 ifip.ktz
