NAME
       selt  - SE-MMC model checker

       Part of Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets.


SYNOPSIS
       muse [-help]

       muse ktzfile [-f formula | formfile] [-prelude mmcfile]
            [-q | -v] [-b | -c | -s] [-wp n]
            [outfile] [errorfile]


DESCRIPTION
       muse  model-checks  state-event  modal  mu-calculus (MMC) formulas on a
       kripke transition system given in ktz format. Muse is  a  global  model
       checker; the result of a query is a set of states or transitions.

       If  some  formula is specified (by  flag -f or by  providing formfile),
       then  the result  of  evaluation  of  the formula  is  printed  accord-
       ing to the output mode and verbosity flags, and muse exits.

       If  no  formula file is  specified,  then  muse  starts an  interactive
       session, evaluating commands entered by the user on standard input (see
       "muse se-mmc language and commands" below).



OPTIONS
       -help  Recalls options.



       Ktz input:


       ktzfile
              The kripke transition system on which formula are model-checked,
              in ktz format (extension .ktz).


       -wp (0|1|2)
              This flag removes (0), preserves (1),  or forces at  each  state
              (2)  the  temporal  divergence  property possibly present in the
              kts file (see tina's -wp flag for details).



       MMC input:


       -f formula
              Passes to muse the formula to be verified.


       formfile
              Specifies a file holding the formulas to be verified. Must  have
              extension .mmc


       -prelude mmcfile
              Specifies  a  file containing muse  commands to be evaluated  on
              entry, before  any formula  provided by  -f, by   formfile,   or
              interactively.    This    flag   is   useful  to   load   SE-MMC
              libraries.   mmcfile must  have extension .mmc.



       Verbosity level:


       -v     prints banner and evaluation times for MMC commands (default).


       -q     No  banner  nor times  are  printed. This  flag  is  useful  for
              batch operation.



       Output mode flags:


       -b     When evaluating a state (resp.  event) formula, prints its truth
              value for state (resp. transition) numbered 0.


       -c     When evaluating a state (resp.  event) formula, prints the  num-
              ber of states (resp. transitions) satisfying the formula.


       -s     When  evaluating  a state (resp.  event) formula, prints the set
              of states (resp. transitions)  satisfying  the  formula.  States
              (resp.   transitions) are numberred in their order of occurrence
              in the ktz file.



       Other flags:


       -S  scnfile
              When a  formula evaluates to FALSE,  writes a  counter   example
              in  .scn format of in file scnfile (creating the file if it does
              not exist, and overwriting  it otherwise).   This flag  is  use-
              ful   to   replay  counter  examples  in  the  nd  stepper  when
              modelchecking  an  existing  ktz description and  a  description
              of  the  net the .ktz file describes the behavior  of  is avail-
              able  (see  "interacting  with  the nd  stepper" below).



       Output destination:


       outfile
              Where results are written.



       Errors destination:


       errorfile
              Where error messages are written. By default, errors are printed
              on standard error.



MUSE SE-MMC LANGUAGE AND COMMANDS
1. Lexical matters:
       - A identifier is either:

       Any   place   or  transition  identifier   allowed  in  .net   or  .ndr
       descriptions, that  is: any  sequence of letters,  digits,  underscores
       "_"  and primes  "'", or any sequence of  characters enclosed in braces
       in which "{", "}" (except the outer ones) and "\" are prefixed by "\"

       Any sequence of symbols from the list ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = :  ?  |
        / < > [ ];

       A qualified identifier: an identifier prefixed by S., E. or L.

       e.g.    hello,  _p4'_,  123,  >=<, or {variable x45}, are legal identi-
       fiers.

       - The commands are: op, infix, prefix, forget,  verb,  output,  source,
       quit, assert.  Command names  may not be used  as operator or  variable
       names.

       - When  analyzing  identifiers,  the  scanner  advances  as  right   as
       possible.   So, in a juxtaposition  of identifiers, two symbolic or two
       alphanumeric unbraced identifiers,  or e.g. an alphanumeric  identifier
       and  a  command name, must  be separated by  a space.  But no  space is
       necessary  between  identifiers  of   different  kinds  or  between   a
       parenthesis (or ";") and an identifier.

       -  justaposition bind  tighter than infixes and associate  to the left,
       infixes and prefixes associate to the  right. That is, if f is a  3-ary
       operator  in  functional  notation, A,  B, -, are prefixes, and /\, \/,
       are infixes:

                      A p1 => B - p3 /\ f u v w
         parses as    (A p1) => ((B (- p3)) /\ (f u v wp))

                      f - B p1 (f p0 p1 (p4 /\ p5)) \/ f u v w
         parses as    (f (- B p1) (f p0 p1 (p4 /\ p5))) \/ (f u v w)

         and          f - B p1 f p0 p1 p4 \/ f u v w
         parses as    (f (- B p1) f p0 p1 p4) \/ (f u v w)
         which is ill-typed

       - infixes  have precedence in  0..5 (see  below). Infixes  with  higher
       precedence bind tighter than those with lower precedence.



2. The initial environment:
       It is made up of (pushed in that order):

       -  The  atomic  state  and  event  propositions. They  have  the  names
       captured in the .ktz file,  i.e. those of the places and transitions of
       the Petri net if the .ktz file was generated by tina.

       - Then, the logic and arithmetic primitives, constituted of:

          constants:  T (true), F (false),
                 div (temporal divergence property),
                 sub (partially defined state or transition)

          prefixes:   - (logic negation), ~ (arithmetic negation),
                 modal operators <f>_ and [f]_, for each transition formula f,
                 ` followed by an integer, designating a state or transition by its rank in the ktz input file,
                 the MEC4 primitives src, tgt, rsrc, rtgt

          infixes:    => (implies), <=> (equivalent), of precedence 1
                 /\ (and), \/ (or), of precedence 2
                 <=, >=, =, le, lt, ge, gt, of precedence 3
                 +, of precedence 4
                 *, of precedence 5
                  - Then the user defined operators.

       Since  the syntactic classes of atomic state propositions, atomic event
       propositions, logic primitives,  integer,  and user defined  operators,
       overlap,   we must have  some way  of disambiguating  identifiers.  For
       this:

       - unqualified identifiers are bound to  the command with than name,  if
       any,  or  otherwise  to  the last bound user defined operator with that
       name.

       - identifiers  qualified by  S (e.g.  S.p1)  are bound  to the   atomic
       state proposition with that name with the qualifier removed (e.g. p1);

       -  identifiers  qualified by  E (e.g.  E.t1)  are bound  to the  atomic
       event proposition with that name with the qualifier removed (e.g. t1);

       - identifiers  qualified by  L  (e.g.  L./\) are  bound  to the   logic
       primitive with that name with the qualifier removed (e.g. /\);

       So,  atomic  propositions (found  in the ktz  file) sharing  their name
       with some atomic propositions in a different group (state or event)  or
       with  some command  (e.g. op), or some logical  primitive (e.g.  -), or
       the name  of which  is an integer  (e.g.  3),  must be referred  to  in
       formulas by their qualified form (e.g.  S.op, E.-, or S.3);



3. Derived forms and fixpoint notation:
       The modalities of the mu-calculus are derived from the MEC4 primitives,
       as follows. They benefit however of a specific concrete syntax:

          <p>q     stands for   src (p /\ rtgt q)
          [p]q   stands for   -<p>(-q)

       Modal mu-calculus makes use of fixpoint expressions:

       - Minimal fixpoint expressions make use of keywords "min" or "mu", fol-
       lowed  by the bound variable and a bar separating the variable from the
       body of the expression, as in  "min x | p  <q>x".

       - Maximal fixpoints makes use of keywords "max" or "nu".

       Note: muse does not perform yet any polarity checks on fixpoint expres-
       sions,  this check is left to the user's responsability. Hence termina-
       tion of  evaluation  is  not  guaranteed  (ill-formed  expressions  may
       diverge).

       (more derived notations to come)


4. Fixity:
       Identifiers  declared  infix (binary  logic primitives or  user defined
       operators declared by "infix") must be used in infix notation;

       Identifiers declared  prefix (unary  logic primitives or  user  defined
       operators  declared by "prefix") must  be used in prefix notation (in a
       juxtaposition  of  identifiers, prefix  operators  associate with   the
       right expression);

       Other  operators  or primitives accessed by their  qualified names must
       be used in functional notation.   E.g. if a1, a2, a3 are  parenthesized
       expressions, and f has arity 3, then:

            a1 /\ a2 and L./\ a1 a2 are legal (and equivalent)
           but a1 L./\ a2 is ill-typed

            f - a1 a2 a3 is legal (parses as ((f (- a1)) a2) a3)
           but f L.- a1 a2 a3 T is ill-typed (parses as (((f L.-) a1) a2) a3)


4. Commands and effects:
       Commands  must terminate with ";".  In formula files, the final ";" may
       be  omitted (EOF  plays that  role). The  effects of  commands  are  as
       follows ("exp" is any ltl expression, x, y, f, xi are identifiers):

       exp;
            evaluates MMC expression exp;
            The result of evaluation of the last expression is always bound
            to identifier "it";

       assert exp "whentrue" "whenfalse";
              in bool output mode, evaluates exp then prints string whentrue
              (resp. whenfalse) if exp holds (resp. does not) instead of the
              default message TRUE (resp. FALSE). Equivalent to exp in other
              modes.

       op f x1 ... xn = exp;
            declares an  operator f  or arity n  (n >=  0), to be  used in
            functional notation;

       infix [n] x f y = exp;
            declares a binary operator f in infix notation. n is an
            optional integer in 0..5 specifying precedence.

       prefix f x = exp;
            declares a unary operator f in prefix notation;

       forget f1 ... fn;
            Removed items names f1 ...  fn from the environment, and their
            fixity information;

       source [file | "file"];
            reads at toplevel the contents of file. The file name is
            optionally surrounded  by string quotes (this  is necessary if
            the name includes spaces);

       verb [true | false | debug];
            verbosity level. Tne initial  setting follows from the command
            line flags -v | -q (default -v);

            true  (default):  prints   the  banner,  prompts,  results  of
            commands, and evaluation times;

            false:  just   prints  the   results  of  evaluation   of  LTL
            expressions (useful in batch mode);

            debug: may print extra information (mainly for developper);

       output [bool | card | set];
            specify   effects   and   results   of  evaluations   of   MMC
            expressions.  The  command  line  flags  -b, -c, -s,
            specifie the initial setting (default -c);

            If the expression evaluated is a state (resp. transition) expression:

            bool: evaluation returns the truth value (TRUE or FALSE) of the
            expression at state 0 (resp. transition 0);

            card (default): evaluation returns the number of states (resp. transitions)
            satisfying the expression;

            set: evaluation returns the set of states (resp. transitions)
            satisfying the expression;

       which exp;
               Like exp; but overrides the default output option by "set";

       card exp;
               Like exp; but overrides the default output option by "card";

       quit
            leaves muse (also ^D on Unix targets).




5. Example commands:
       p1;            (eqv. p1 lt 0  p gt 0)
       - p1;          (eqv. p1 = 0)
       p1 /\ p2 >= 2;      (eqv. p1 /\ (p2 >= 2))
       op x > y = x >= y + 1;   (declares arithmetic operator >, in infix form)
       p1+p2;              (eqv. p1+p2 >= 0, eqv. p1 \/ p2)
       p1+p2 > p3;
       p1*p2 = 0;
       infix y follows x = [] (x => <>y);
                      (declares logical operator "follows:, in infix form)
       (t3 \/ p5) follows (t1 /\ p1>=p2);
                 (eqv. [] ((t1 /\ (p1>=p2)) => <> (t3 \/ p5)));
