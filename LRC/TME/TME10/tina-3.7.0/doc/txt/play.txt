NAME
       play  - Tina stepper simulator

       Part of Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets.



SYNOPSIS
       play [-help]
            [-NET | -NDR | -TPN | -PNML | -TTS]
            [-seed] [-inh] [-tc] [-dt] [-pr] [-sw]
            [infile] [outfile] [errorfile]



DESCRIPTION
       Tool   play allows  to  simulate  net descriptions  in  any of  formats
       .net,  .ndr,  .tpn, .pnml  or  .tts.   Its capabilities  are similar to
       those  provided  by  the  nd stepper except that play may also simulate
       .tts descriptions.

       A simulation  is a  series of states  separated by  transitions  (delay
       transitions  or  discrete transitions). Play  allows one to  build such
       sequences and navigate within, interactively.



OPTIONS
       -help  Recalls options.



       Verbosity level:


       -v     Prints  banner,  parsing  message  and  prompts   for   commands
              (default).


       -q     No  banner  nor  times  are printed. This flag is convenient for
              batch usage of play.


       Exploration strategy options:


       -seed  Initializes the random number generator so that different  calls
              of play on the same arguments have a chance to explore different
              paths (if any).


       Input options:


       -inh   Forget inhibitor arcs in the input net.


       -pr    Forget priority constraints in the input net.


       -tc    Forget time constraints  in the input net.


       -dt    Forget data processing when reading a tts description.


       -sw    Forget stopwatches in the input net.



       Input format and source:


       -NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN | -TTS
              Specifies the format of the input net. This  flag  is  necessary
              when  the  input  net  is read on standard input, or read from a
              file that does not bear the expected extension. By default,  the
              net is assumed in .net or


       infile Where  the   net  is   read. The  input format is  determined by
              the file type, according to the table below. If absent or speci-
              fied  by "-", the net is  read on standard  input in the  format
              specified by  the input flag. If   both  an   infile  and   some
              input flag  are present,  then the format defined  by the  input
              flag supersedes  that determined  by the infile extension.

              file extension      input format
              --------------------------------------------------------------
              .net           net format
              .ndr           ndr format
              .tpn           tpn format
              .pnml               pnml format
              .tts           tts format



       Output destination:


       outfile
              Where results are written.  If  absent  or  specified   by  "-",
              results are written on standard output.



       Errors destination:


       errorfile
              Where  error  messages  are  written. If absent or specified  by
              "-", error messages are written on standard error.




PLAY STEPPER INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       When  called, play prints  the initial  state of  the input  net,  with
       information  about  the enabled,  frozen and firable  transitions, then
       waits for commands. These commands are the following.


       h      Prints a short summary of available commands.


       f tr   Fires transition with name tr. tr must be among the  transitions
              shown as firable.


       # n    Fires the n^th transition in the firable list of transitions.


       d k    Let delay k elapse from current state, k is an integer of a num-
              ber in floating point notation.


       r n    Randomly fire n random steps and print last  state  reached.   A
              step is delay followed by a discrete transition.


       R n    Like "r n" except intermediate states are printed.


       m      Sets a mark on the current state (for commands << and >> below).


       < [n]  Undoes [n times] in history the last state transition (delay  or
              discrete). Default n is 1.


       > [n]  Redoes  [n times] in history the next state transition (delay or
              discrete). Default n is 1.  Redo n is only possible if at  least
              n  state  transitions  are  available in the history, that is if
              some undo have been done before.


       << [n] Jump backward [n times] in  history  to  the  previously  marked
              state or the initial state.


       >> [n] Jump  forward  [n  times] in history to the next marked state or
              the last state.


       |<     Jump to the initial state.


       >|     Jump to the last state stored.


       .      Prints the current state.


       l file Load a scenario file in .scn format generated by  selt,  pathto,
              plan  or  play.   If  the input net is timed, then the .scn file
              must be timed too.


       s file Save the current history as a .scn file. If  the  input  net  is
              timed, then the .scn will be timed too.


       k (true|false)
              Keep  history (default) or not when applying commands f, d, r or
              R. Not keeping history permits long simulations that could  oth-
              erwise  exhaust  memory.  Navigation commands (<, >, <<, >>, |<,
              |>, m) are only available when history is kept.


       q or ^D
              Quit play.
